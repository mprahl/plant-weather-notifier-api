# plant-weather-notifier-api
A REST API that notifies a user of particular weather conditions for their plants.

## Coding Standards

The codebase conforms to the style enforced by `flake8` with the following exceptions:

* The maximum line length allowed is 100 characters instead of 80 characters

In addition to `flake8`, docstrings are also enforced by the plugin `flake8-docstrings` with
the following exemptions:

* D100: Missing docstring in public module
* D104: Missing docstring in public package
* D105: Missing docstring in magic method

The format of the docstrings should be in the
[reStructuredText](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/documentation/#restructuredtext-ref) style
such as:

```python
"""
Add two numbers together.

:param int num_one: the first number
:param int num_two: the second number
:return: the sum of ``num_one`` and ``num_two``
:rtype: int
:raises TypeError: if the input values are not integers
"""
```

Additionally, `black` is used to enforce other coding standards with the following exceptions:

* Single quotes are used instead of double quotes

To verify that your code meets these standards, you may run `tox -e black,flake8`.

## Running the Unit Tests

The testing environment is managed by [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Simply run
`tox` and all the linting and unit tests will run.

If you'd like to run a specific unit test, you can do the following:

```bash
tox -e py37 tests/test_api_v1.py::test_get_plants
```

## Dependency Management

To manage dependencies, this project uses [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) so that
the production dependencies are pinned and the hashes of the dependencies are verified during
installation.

The unpinned dependencies are recorded in `setup.py`, and to generate the `requirements.txt` file,
run `pip-compile --generate-hashes --output-file=requirements.txt`. This is only necessary when
adding a new package. To upgrade a package, use the `-P` argument of the `pip-compile` command.

To update `requirements-test.txt`, run
`pip-compile --generate-hashes setup.py requirements-test.in -o requirements-test.txt`.

When installing the dependencies in a production environment, run
`pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt`. Alternatively, you may use
`pip-sync requirements.txt`, which will make sure your virtualenv only has the packages listed in
`requirements.txt`.
